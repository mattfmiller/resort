    <h3>What are our guests saying about us?</h3>
    <p>
      "The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We'll play with clouds today. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. In your world you can create anything you desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Let's have a little bit of fun today. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. This is truly an almighty mountain. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush."
