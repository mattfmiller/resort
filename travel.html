      How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Have fun with it. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.
